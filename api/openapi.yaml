    System for Cross-Domain Identity Management ([SCIM](http://www.simplecloud.info/)) is a standard implemented by Identity Providers and applications in order to facilitate federated identity management. Through these APIs you can add and delete members as well as teams. Sentry SaaS customers must be on a Business Plan with SAML2 Enabled. SCIM uses a bearer token for authentication that is created when SCIM is enabled. For how to enable SCIM, see our docs [here](/product/accounts/sso/#scim-provisioning).
     Sentry's SCIM API does not currently support syncing passwords, or setting any User attributes other than `active`.

        Creates a new check-in for a monitor.

        If `status` is not present, it will be assumed that the check-in is starting, and be marked as `in_progress`.

        To achieve a ping-like behavior, you can simply define `status` and optionally `duration` and
        this check-in will be automatically marked as finished.

        Note: If a DSN is utilized for authentication, the response will be limited in details.

        Retrieves discover (also known as events) data for a given organization.

        **Eventsv2 Deprecation Note**: Users who may be using the `eventsv2` endpoint should update their requests to the `events` endpoint outline in this document.
        The `eventsv2` endpoint is not a public endpoint and has no guaranteed availability. If you are not making any API calls to `eventsv2`, you can safely ignore this.
        Changes between `eventsv2` and `events` include:
        - Field keys in the response now match the keys in the requested `field` param exactly.
        - The `meta` object in the response now shows types in the nested `field` object.

        Aside from the url change, there are no changes to the request payload itself.

        **Note**: This endpoint is intended to get a table of results, and is not for doing a full export of data sent to
        Sentry.

        The `field` query parameter determines what fields will be selected in the `data` and `meta` keys of the endpoint response.
        - The `data` key contains a list of results row by row that match the `query` made
        - The `meta` key contains information about the response, including the unit or type of the fields requested

              - example: `field=transaction`

        Submit and associate user feedback with an issue.

        Feedback must be received by the server no more than 30 minutes after the event was saved.

        Additionally, within 5 minutes of submitting feedback it may also be overwritten. This is useful in situations where you may need to retry sending a request due to network failures.

        If feedback is rejected due to a mutability threshold, a 409 status code will be returned.

        Note: Feedback may be submitted with DSN authentication (see auth documentation).

        Create a new release for the given organization.  Releases are used by
        Sentry to improve its error reporting abilities by correlating
        first seen events with the release that might have introduced the
        problem.
        Releases are also necessary for source maps and other debug features
        that require manual upload for functioning well.
